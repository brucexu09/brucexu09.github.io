I'm third-year PhD candidate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** from **UC Santa Barbara**, advised by [Prof.Peng Li](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~lip/). My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and computer architecture. Specifically, **Brain-inspired Machine Learning** and **Efficient ML/LLM computing systems**. 

Before this, I received my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Prof.David Blaauw](https://blaauw.engin.umich.edu/) and [Prof.Dennis Sylvester](https://sylvester.engin.umich.edu/), and B.S. in Electronic Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by [Prof.Bei Yu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/) at CUHK and [Prof.Udo Schwingenschl√∂gl](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/udo-schwingenschlogl) at KAUST.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I'm actively looking for research discussion and collaboration focused on Generative Model's efficiency issues and general applications. Feel free to reach out and keep in touch for future opportunities!


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

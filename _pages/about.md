I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, advised by Prof. Peng Li (Fellow of IEEE). My research interest focuses on the intersection of machine learning and computer architecture. Specifically, **brain-inspired machine learning**, **efficient ML systems**, and **multimodal content generation**. I received consecutive **Best Paper Award Nomination** at **ICCAD 2024** and **ICCAD 2025**. I also completed research internships at Meta in 2024 and at Meta SuperIntelligence Labs in 2025. 

Before this, I received my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Prof.David Blaauw (Fellow of IEEE) and Prof.Dennis Sylvester (Fellow of IEEE), and B.S. in Electronic Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof.Bei Yu at CUHK and Prof.Udo Schwingenschlögl at KAUST.

Since 2025, my research has focused on efficient and scalable world models. I am always open to research discussions and collaborations on the efficiency and scalability of generative models and their applications. Feel free to reach out to connect or explore potential future opportunities.

<!-- I am also seeking industrial positions starting Fall 2026. Feel free to reach out via email (boxunxu AT ucsb.edu) if there are opportunities aligned with my expertise. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

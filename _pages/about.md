I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, advised by Prof.Peng Li (IEEE Fellow). My research interests focus on the intersection of machine learning and computer architecture. Specifically, **brain-inspired machine learning**, **efficient ML systems**, and **multimodal content generation**.
I received consecutive **William J. McCalla Best Paper Award** nominations at ICCAD 2024 and ICCAD 2025.
I also completed research internships at Meta in 2024 and at Meta Superintelligence Labs(MSL) in 2025.

Since 2025, my research has focused on efficient and scalable multimodal generative models and world models.

I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. David Blaauw (IEEE Fellow) and Prof. Dennis Sylvester (IEEE Fellow), and my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
